    "### Key Changes and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removed Redundant Descriptors\n",
    "- **Removed**: `Chi0v`, `Chi1v`, `Chi2v`, etc.  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Kept `Chi0n` and `Chi4n` for simplicity and interpretability. Higher-order connectivity indices (`Chi1v`, `Chi2v`, etc.) are often redundant and add unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removed**: `ExactMolWt`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Redundant with `HeavyAtomMolWt`. `HeavyAtomMolWt` is more relevant for drug-likeness as it excludes hydrogens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removed**: `Kappa2` and `Kappa3`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Kept `Kappa1` for shape simplicity. Higher-order kappa indices (`Kappa2`, `Kappa3`) are less interpretable and often do not add significant predictive value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removed**: `EState_VSA1`, `EState_VSA2`, etc.  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Kept `EState_VSA3` as a representative polar surface descriptor. Other EState_VSA descriptors are often correlated and redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Added Chemically Meaningful Descriptors\n",
    "- **Added**: `NumHDonors` and `NumHAcceptors`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Explicit counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more interpretable than `NHOHCount`. These are critical for target engagement and solubility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Added**: `TPSA` (Topological Polar Surface Area)  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Critical for predicting permeability and absorption. It is a well-established descriptor in drug discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Added**: `NumRotatableBonds`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Measures molecular flexibility, which is important for binding entropy and conformational adaptation to targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Added**: `NumHeteroatoms`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Heteroatom count influences interactions with bacterial targets and overall molecular diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retained Key Descriptors\n",
    "- **Retained**: `MolLogP`, `FractionCSP3`, `LabuteASA`, and `NumAromaticRings`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: These descriptors are strongly relevant to drug-likeness and anti-TB activity.  \n",
    "  - `MolLogP`: Lipophilicity (critical for membrane penetration).  \n",
    "  - `FractionCSP3`: Measures saturation (linked to metabolic stability).  \n",
    "  - `LabuteASA`: Approximate surface area (permeability predictor).  \n",
    "  - `NumAromaticRings`: Aromatic interactions with bacterial enzymes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplified Connectivity Indices\n",
    "- **Kept**: `Chi0n` and `Chi4n`  \n",
    "  **Reason**: Representative connectivity indices that capture molecular branching and complexity. Removed others (`Chi1v`, `Chi2v`, etc.) to reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removed Low-Impact Descriptors\n",
    "- **Removed**: `MaxAbsEStateIndex`, `MinAbsEStateIndex`, and other EState indices  \n",
    "  **Reason**: These are less interpretable and often redundant with other descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removed**: `FpDensityMorgan1`, `FpDensityMorgan2`, etc.  \n",
    "  **Reason**: These are fingerprint-based descriptors and not true molecular descriptors. They are better suited for similarity-based methods rather than descriptor-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Changes\n",
    "- **Reduced redundancy**: Removed highly correlated or less interpretable descriptors.\n",
    "- **Added chemically meaningful descriptors**: Focused on properties directly relevant to drug-likeness and anti-TB activity.\n",
    "- **Simplified connectivity indices**: Kept only the most representative indices.\n",
    "- **Removed low-impact descriptors**: Eliminated descriptors that do not contribute significantly to predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "This refined list balances interpretability, chemical relevance, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for your anti-tuberculosis activity prediction model.\n"

    "# Molecular Descriptors to Complement GNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "This document lists the key molecular descriptors that should be used alongside a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** for predicting antimycobacterial activity.

    "\n",
    "### **Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Graph-based descriptor that quantifies molecular shape complexity.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Fraction of sp3 Hybridized Carbons (Fsp3)**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Ratio of sp3 hybridized carbons to total carbons.\n",
    "- **Why it's important:** Higher Fsp3 correlates with increased solubility and metabolic stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Molecular Rigidity Score**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Measure of overall molecular flexibility.\n",
    "- **Why it's important:** Affects the ability to diffuse through bacterial membranes.\n",

    "## 4. ADMET & Pharmacokinetics\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CYP Inhibition Score**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Predicts the likelihood of a compound inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n",
